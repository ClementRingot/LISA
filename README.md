# LISA — Localization & Internationalization Service for ABAP

> Let AI assistants read, write and compare **SAP object translations** through a single, secure MCP server.

**LISA** (Localization & Internationalization Service for ABAP) is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that lets AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, VS Code, …) manage the translation of SAP repository objects — data elements, domains, CDS views, message classes, class/function-group text pools, and more — without leaving the chat.

It is built the same way as [**ARC-1**](https://github.com/marianfoo/arc-1) (same XSUAA auth proxy, same BTP connectivity model, same Express/MCP-SDK transport), but instead of the full ADT toolset it exposes **3 focused translation tools** backed by a small ABAP HTTP service that wraps SAP's [XCO i18n APIs](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-development-tools-user-guide/internationalization-i18n).

> **Deployment target:** `LISA` is designed to run on **SAP BTP (Cloud Foundry)** — that is the primary, supported way to use it (XSUAA login + principal propagation to SAP). Running it **locally** is fully supported too, but it is meant for **development and testing**, not production. The two paths are [Part 2 (BTP)](#part-2--deploy-to-sap-btp-recommended) and [Part 3 (local)](#part-3--run-locally-development--testing) below.

## How it works

```
┌──────────────┐   MCP/HTTP    ┌────────────────────┐   HTTPS (JSON)    ┌──────────────────────────┐
│  AI assistant│ ────────────> │  LISA MCP          │ ───────────────>  │  SAP ABAP system         │
│ (Claude/IDE) │   3 tools     │(Node.js, this repo)│  /zi18n_service   │  ZCL_I18N_SERVICE(_CLOUD)│
└──────────────┘ <──────────── └────────────────────┘ <───────────────  │  → XCO i18n APIs         │
                                                                        └──────────────────────────┘
```

There are **two halves** to a working setup:

1. **The ABAP service** — a handler class (`ZCL_I18N_SERVICE(_CLOUD)`) that you import into your SAP system and expose as an ABAP **HTTP service**. It does the actual translation work using the XCO i18n APIs. → see [`abap/`](./abap) and [docs: ABAP service setup](./docs_page/abap-service-setup.md).
2. **The MCP server** — this Node.js project. It authenticates the caller, propagates their identity to SAP, and translates MCP tool calls into HTTP calls to the ABAP service.

---

## The 3 tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `TranslateListLanguages` | List all languages installed on the SAP system. |
| `TranslateGetTexts` | Read all translatable texts of an object in a given language (or its original language when none is given). Each slot comes back with its full key (`level`, `field_name`, `position`, `attribute`), its `value`, and a `populated` flag (`false` = empty in this language = still to translate). |
| `TranslateSetTexts` | Write/update translations (requires a transport request). Each text entry may carry its own `field_name`/`position`, so all fields of one CDS view (e.g. every `ui_lineitem_label`) are written in a single call — locking the object only once. |

> **Discover / list / compare** all collapse into `TranslateGetTexts`: read with no `language` to see the original-language slots, keep `populated === true` to list only filled texts, and call it once per language and diff on `(key, populated, value)` to compare.

### Supported object types (`target_type`)

These are XCO **semantic** literals, not DDIC short codes:

| `target_type` | SAP object | Typical attributes |
|---------------|-----------|--------------------|
| `data_element` | Data element (DTEL) | `short_field_label`, `medium_field_label`, `long_field_label`, `heading_field_label` |
| `domain` | Domain fixed-value texts (DOMA) | `fixed_value_description` |
| `data_definition` | CDS view (DDLS) entity/field labels | `endusertext_label` |
| `message_class` | Message class (MSAG) | `message_short_text` |
| `text_pool` | Class / function-group text symbols | text symbol values |
| `metadata_extension` | CDS metadata extension (DDLX) UI labels | `endusertext_label` |
| `application_log_object` | Application log object (APLO) | object / sub-object texts |
| `business_configuration_object` | Business configuration object (SMBC) | description texts |

> **CDS views & metadata extensions:** a CDS view's UI labels are frequently defined (or overridden) in a separate **metadata extension** (DDLX). To translate *all* of a view's texts, read both `data_definition` (the view) **and** the matching `metadata_extension` object (its own DDLX name) — the tool descriptions surface this reminder to the assistant.

---

## Use it alongside an ADT MCP server

`LISA` is focused on the **translation** step — it deliberately does *not* discover objects or manage transports. For an interactive, AI-driven workflow it is designed to be used **next to an ADT MCP server** (e.g. [ARC-1](https://github.com/marianfoo/arc-1)), which provides the surrounding capabilities:

- **object discovery** — find the data element / CDS view / message class to translate;
- **transport handling** — locate or create the transport request that `TranslateSetTexts` requires;
- **inspection** — read the object before translating it.

Typical division of labour: the **ADT MCP** finds the object and a transport → **LISA** reads, writes and compares its translations. On its own, `LISA` still works whenever the object name and transport are already known (e.g. batch or scripted translation).

---

## Prerequisites

- An SAP system with the **XCO i18n APIs** available (S/4HANA 2022+ / ABAP Platform 2022+ / ABAP Cloud) and the new HTTP handler model (`IF_HTTP_SERVICE_EXTENSION`).
- Authorization to import a class and create an ABAP **HTTP service** (ADT), plus rights to expose it: via `UCON_HTTP_SERVICES` (on-premise / private cloud) or a **communication scenario** (BTP ABAP Environment / public cloud).
- **Node.js 22.x** to run the MCP server.
- For production: an **SAP BTP** subaccount (Cloud Foundry) with XSUAA, Destination and Connectivity services.

## Part 1 — Install the ABAP service

The ABAP handler to copy into your **target SAP system** lives in [`abap/`](./abap). There are **two variants — pick the one class that matches your stack**. Each is **fully self-contained** (the JSON/parameter helpers are inlined), so you import exactly **one** file, with no shared interface or utility class to import alongside it.

| File | Object | Use when |
|------|--------|----------|
| [`abap/zcl_i18n_service.clas.abap`](./abap/zcl_i18n_service.clas.abap) | `ZCL_I18N_SERVICE` | **On-premise / private cloud** — classic ABAP stack (S/4HANA 2022+ / ABAP Platform 2022+). |
| [`abap/zcl_i18n_service_cloud.clas.abap`](./abap/zcl_i18n_service_cloud.clas.abap) | `ZCL_I18N_SERVICE_CLOUD` | **SAP BTP ABAP Environment / public cloud** (Steampunk) — Cloud-API-compliant variant. |

Both implement `IF_HTTP_SERVICE_EXTENSION`, route actions from the URL path, and speak the **same wire contract** — they only differ in the released/Cloud-compliant APIs the public-cloud stack allows. Import the one file for your stack (abapGit, or paste via ADT), create an ABAP **HTTP service** whose handler class is that class, and **enable** it (`UCON_HTTP_SERVICES` on-premise / private cloud; a communication scenario on ABAP Environment). Point the MCP at its URL (default `/sap/bc/http/sap/zi18n_service`).

## Part 2 — Deploy to SAP BTP (recommended)

This is the **main way to run `LISA`**. It deploys to Cloud Foundry as an MTA and uses **XSUAA for authentication only** — there are **no scopes, role templates or role collections**. XSUAA proves the caller's identity; the JWT is propagated to SAP (principal propagation via the Destination + Connectivity services), and **SAP's own authorization objects** decide what each user may read, write or translate. Every authenticated user gets all 3 tools.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
mbt build           # produces mta_archives/lisa_0.1.0.mtar
cf deploy mta_archives/lisa_0.1.0.mtar
```

Then set the DCR signing secret (one-off) and point your MCP client at the deployed URL:

```bash
cf set-env lisa-mcp LISA_DCR_SIGNING_SECRET "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
cf restage lisa-mcp
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lisa": { "url": "https://lisa-<space>.<domain>/mcp" }
  }
}
```

The client is redirected through XSUAA login on first use; its identity is then propagated to SAP per call.

👉 Full guide: **[docs: BTP deployment](./docs_page/btp-deployment.md)** · **[docs: authentication](./docs_page/authentication.md)** · the [`mta.yaml`](./mta.yaml) / [`xs-security.json`](./xs-security.json).

> **Why `LISA_DCR_SIGNING_SECRET`?** Without it the OAuth dynamic-client store signs with the XSUAA `clientsecret`, which `cf deploy` rotates — invalidating all cached MCP client registrations on every deploy. It's a secret, so it lives in `cf set-env`, not `mta.yaml`.

---

## Part 3 — Run locally (development & testing)

For local development you connect **directly** to SAP (BasicAuth) — no BTP services involved. This path is for trying things out and developing the server; **production should run on BTP** (Part 2).

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd LISA
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # then edit .env
npm run dev               # tsx src/index.ts  (hot dev)
# or
npm run build && npm start
```

Minimum local `.env`:

```bash
SAP_URL=https://your-abap-system.example.com
SAP_USERNAME=ABAP_USER
SAP_PASSWORD=secret
SAP_CLIENT=100
SAP_I18N_SERVICE_PATH=/sap/bc/http/sap/zi18n_service
MCP_TRANSPORT=http-streamable      # or "stdio"
PORT=8080
```

By default the server starts an HTTP-streamable MCP endpoint on `http://localhost:8080/mcp` with a `/health` probe.

**Connect an MCP client over HTTP** (Claude web/desktop, Cursor, VS Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lisa": { "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp" }
  }
}
```

**Or over stdio** (local-only, no auth) — set `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio` and launch the built server directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lisa": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/LISA/dist/index.js"],
      "env": { "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio", "SAP_URL": "…", "SAP_USERNAME": "…", "SAP_PASSWORD": "…" }
    }
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ Local mode has **no XSUAA in front of it** — with no auth vars set the HTTP transport is open, and SAP calls use a single technical user instead of per-user principal propagation. Keep it on your machine; don't expose it. For anything shared or production-grade, use **BTP (Part 2)**.

## Roadmap

Forward-looking work — **planned, not implemented** — lives in [`roadmap/`](./roadmap/README.md).
Two independent tracks:

| Track | Doc | In one line |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Distribute LISA as an ARC-1 extension | [`roadmap/arc1-extension.md`](./roadmap/arc1-extension.md) | When ARC-1's extension framework reaches **v2**, repackage LISA's 3 tools as in-process `Custom_*` tools. |
| Share the auth layer (standalone) | [`roadmap/shared-auth-module.md`](./roadmap/shared-auth-module.md) | Replace LISA's in-tree XSUAA/BTP auth with a dependency on [`@arc-mcp/xsuaa-auth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arc-mcp/xsuaa-auth). |
